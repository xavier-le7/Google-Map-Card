# Attention

💡 Google Maps JavaScript API must be enabled in your Google Cloud project:
[https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list)

If you plan to use the **Route Search and Travel Time Calculator**, you also need to enable these additional APIs:

| API | Purpose | Required for |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Maps JavaScript API** | Core map rendering | All features (required) |
| **Directions API** | Route calculation, alternatives, duration & distance | Route Search and Travel Time Calculator |
| **Places API (New)** | Address autocomplete in travel panel | Route Search and Travel Time Calculator |
| **Routes API** | Real-time traffic segment data for color-coded polylines | Route Search and Travel Time Calculator |

# 💰 API Pricing & Free Quotas — You're Probably Fine

Google Maps Platform follows a "Pay-as-you-go" model, but don't let that scare you — **Google provides a very generous free tier that comfortably covers typical Home Assistant usage.** Most home users will never come close to the limits.

Here's how much you get for free every month (as of March 2025):

| Feature | Required API | Free Monthly Limit | What That Means for You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Map Rendering** | Maps JavaScript API (Dynamic Maps) | **10,000** map loads | ~330 map loads/day — plenty for a household dashboard |
| **Route Calculation** | Directions API | **10,000** requests | ~330 routes/day — way more than daily commute checks |
| **Address Autocomplete** | Places API (New) | **10,000** requests | ~330 autocomplete sessions/day |
| **Live Traffic Routes** | Routes API | **5,000 – 10,000** requests | More than enough for regular route queries |

To put this in perspective: if you open your HA dashboard 10 times a day and calculate 5 routes, that's still only ~450 map loads and ~150 API calls in a month — **well under 5% of your free quota.** You'd need to be loading the map hundreds of times daily to even approach the limits.

> 💡 **In short:** For personal / household use, the free tier is more than enough. You won't pay a cent unless you do something unusual.

To use all features of this card (including the Route Calculator), you need to enable the required APIs in your Google Cloud project: [API List](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list)

### ❓ Why does my Quotas page say "Unlimited"?

If you check your Google Cloud Quotas page, you might see **"Unlimited"** next to *Map loads per day*. This doesn't mean you'll be charged without warning — it just means Google won't technically block your requests if traffic spikes. Billing only kicks in after the **10,000 monthly free loads**, and for a typical home setup you'll stay well within that.

That said, if you want extra peace of mind (always a good idea!), you can set a daily cap yourself:

### 🛡️ Optional Safety Steps (Recommended)

These are simple one-time steps to make sure you're fully protected — they only take a minute:

1. **Set a daily quota cap** — Go to **APIs & Services → Quotas** and lower the "Unlimited" daily limit to something comfortable (e.g., 200/day). This creates a hard ceiling so you can never accidentally exceed the free tier.
2. **Create a budget alert** — Go to **Billing → Budgets & Alerts** and set a $1–2/month alert. Google will email you if costs approach your threshold. Think of it as a smoke detector — you'll probably never hear it, but it's nice to have.
3. **Restrict your API key** — Limit it to only the APIs you actually use.

![image5](images/kota.png)

You can always check your actual usage here: [Google Maps API Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/quotas)

For a great walkthrough on setting up your API key safely, check out this video by @BeardedTinker:
[https://youtu.be/usGLOxtXCxA?si=BxDj65bksi_tcZek](https://youtu.be/usGLOxtXCxA?si=BxDj65bksi_tcZek)

### 🚗 Route Calculator — Built-in Safety Net

Each route calculation triggers multiple API calls behind the scenes (Directions + Routes + Places autocomplete), so 50 route calculations could mean ~150+ total API calls. To keep things safe by default, **this card has a built-in soft limit of 50 route calculations per day per API key** (shared across all browser instances). That's still plenty for daily use — you'd have to actively try to hit it.

> 💡 For the best protection, combine this built-in limit with a hard daily quota in your Google Cloud Console (see the safety steps above). Belt and suspenders!

Create your API key and click the “Show key” button in the console:

# Installation

## Via HACS

1. Go to **HACS**
2. Search for **Google Map Card**
3. Download & install

---

# Adding the Card to Dashboard

Add via the Lovelace card picker (search “Google Map Card”)
or define it in YAML (see Card Example below):

<br>

![image11](images/gm11.png)

<br>

## 📐 Dashboard Layout Tips

### Standard Dashboard (Masonry / Panel)

Use `aspect_ratio` to control the card height:

```yaml
type: custom:google-map-card
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
aspect_ratio: "16:9"   # or 4:3, 1:1, 400px, etc.
```

### Sections Dashboard

If you are using Home Assistant’s **Sections** dashboard layout, the recommended approach is to use `aspect_ratio`** and rows: auto

```yaml
type: custom:google-map-card
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
grid_options:
  columns: full
  rows: auto
```

With `rows: auto` the card height is determined by `aspect_ratio`

> 💡 **Tip:** Leaving `aspect_ratio` empty without setting `grid_options: columns: full` may cause the card to render with zero height on some Sections layouts. Always use one approach or the other.


### Panel Layout

If you are using Home Assistant’s **Panel** dashboard layout, the recommended approach is to leave `aspect_ratio`* empty

<br>

# 🚗 Route Search and Travel Time Calculator (v5.0.4)

![image64](images/rou.png)

Calculate real-time travel times between any combination of **entities**, **zones**, or **typed addresses** — directly from your dashboard. The panel supports driving, walking, transit, and cycling modes with **live traffic visualization** on the map.

## What you get

* **Docked travel panel** with flexible positioning (above / below the map)
* **Map-based route info bar** — after calculating, a compact bar appears at the top of the map showing travel time, distance, and route name. No list, no clutter.
* **Multi-modal routing** — Driving 🚗, Walking 🚶, Transit 🚌, Cycling 🚴
* **Live traffic-colored routes** for driving mode:
  * 🟢 Green — Normal flow
  * 🟡 Yellow — Slow traffic
  * 🔴 Red — Heavy traffic / Traffic jam
* **Alternative routes** — click any route line on the map or use Prev / Next in the info bar to switch between options
* **Address autocomplete** — powered by Places API (New) with instant suggestions
* **Route Shortcuts** ⚡ — define frequently used routes with custom icons and labels for one-tap calculation
  * Selected shortcut is highlighted so you always know which one is active
  * Supports `person`, `device_tracker`, and `zone` entities
  * Collapsible editor with label-based headers
* **Toggle button** on the map to show/hide the panel — optional, position configurable in Map Button Positioning. Panel opens automatically on first load.
* **Fullscreen support** — the panel and route info bar stay visible in fullscreen mode, anchored to the bottom of the screen

### Required APIs

The Route Search and Travel Time Calculator requires these additional APIs to be enabled in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library):

* **Directions API** — Route calculation
* **Places API (New)** — Address autocomplete
* **Routes API** — Traffic segment data


# 🌍 Map & Format Language

By default, the card uses your Home Assistant profile language for map labels (city names, streets) and in-card date/number formatting. If you'd like the map to display in a different language — for example, you run HA in English but want city names in your native script (Cyrillic, Japanese, Arabic, etc.) — set the `language` option.

```yaml
type: custom:google-map-card
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
language: ja          # BCP-47 tag: en, tr, de, ja, ru, he, ar, etc.
entities:
  - person.alice
```

You can also pick the language from the visual editor's **Map Language** dropdown.

> ⚠️ Google Maps reads the language only at script load time. After changing this setting, do a full page reload (Ctrl+Shift+R) for map labels to update.

Leave the option empty (or omit it) to fall back to your Home Assistant profile language.

---

# 📅 External Date Control

You can bind the card's history date range to one or more Home Assistant `input_datetime` entities. This lets a single date picker on your dashboard drive both the map and other cards (markdown logs, tables, statistics) at the same time — no more selecting the date twice.

## Two modes

**Single day** — one entity, automatically expanded to that day's full 00:00–23:59 range:

```yaml
type: custom:google-map-card
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
history_date_entity: input_datetime.map_date
entities:
  - person.alice
  - person.bob
```

**Date range** — explicit start and end (each with optional time):

```yaml
type: custom:google-map-card
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
history_start_entity: input_datetime.history_start
history_end_entity: input_datetime.history_end
entities:
  - person.alice
```

## Required Home Assistant helpers

Create the helpers under **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → + Create Helper → Date and/or time**, or in YAML:

```yaml
input_datetime:
  map_date:
    name: Map Date
    has_date: true
    has_time: false

  history_start:
    name: History Start
    has_date: true
    has_time: true

  history_end:
    name: History End
    has_date: true
    has_time: true
```

## How it works

- The map updates automatically whenever the `input_datetime` value changes
- The internal date picker button becomes read-only — clicking it shows a tooltip indicating the date is controlled externally
- Multiple cards bound to the same entity stay in sync
- All `input_datetime` formats are supported: date-only, time-only, date + time, and the underlying `timestamp` attribute
- If both single-date and range entities are configured, the range form takes precedence
- Configurable from the visual editor in the **External Date Control** section

## Use case: synchronized tracking dashboard

Combine with previous/next day scripts and a markdown card to build a tracking dashboard where one date picker drives everything:

```yaml
script:
  datepicker_previous_day:
    sequence:
      - service: input_datetime.set_datetime
        target:
          entity_id: input_datetime.map_date
        data:
          date: >
            {{ (states('input_datetime.map_date') | as_datetime
                - timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}

  datepicker_next_day:
    sequence:
      - service: input_datetime.set_datetime
        target:
          entity_id: input_datetime.map_date
        data:
          date: >
            {{ (states('input_datetime.map_date') | as_datetime
                + timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}
```

Bind the same `input_datetime.map_date` to both the map card and any markdown / entity / table card on the dashboard, and they'll all show the same day's data.

# Live Traffic Info by Google Maps

Optional. Real time traffic layer

![image7](images/traffic.png)

---

# Live Weather Layer by OpenWeather API (Optional)

![image7](images/cloud.png)

You need to create api key from openweathermap.org. Please create API v1.0. It is free. Please find the section below and create free API on [https://openweathermap.org/price](https://openweathermap.org/price). **DO NOT** create API of One Call API 3.0

API v1.0 is enough and it is free.

![image7](images/free.png)

## Weather Layer Appearance

By default, the weather layer renders at 60% opacity. Some layers (especially temperature) can obscure the map underneath. You can fine-tune how the layer looks using four settings, all available in the visual editor under the Layers section:

```yaml
weather_layer: temp_new
weather_layer_opacity: 0.4       # more transparent so the map stays visible
weather_layer_brightness: 0.9    # slightly dimmed
weather_layer_contrast: 1.4      # sharper weather patterns
weather_layer_saturation: 0.6    # softer colors
```

All four default to sensible values and only need to be set when you want to override them.

---

# 🌐 Data Layers (v5.15)

Six opt-in live overlays turn the card into a lightweight data dashboard. **Everything defaults to OFF** — with none configured, the card behaves exactly as before and makes zero extra network requests. Each overlay has an **on-map toggle button** whose visibility & position are set in the editor's **Controls** tab (kept separate from the layer's load-time state).

### 🌗 Day/Night Overlay — no API, no key, works offline
Shades the night side of the Earth with civil and nautical twilight bands, refreshed every minute. Computed entirely in-card with astronomy math — no internet service involved. Works in both raster and vector modes.
```yaml
daynight: true            # on at load
show_daynight_button: true
```

### 🏭 Air Quality Layer (WAQI)
Real-time air-quality heatmap tiles from the World Air Quality Index project — the same one-minute free-token setup as OpenWeatherMap. Great during wildfire-smoke season.
```yaml
waqi_token: YOUR_FREE_TOKEN   # aqicn.org/data-platform/token
show_waqi_button: true
```

### 🌧️ Animated Rain Radar (RainViewer)
The past ~2 hours of precipitation radar animating over your map — free, no key. Best at regional zoom levels (the free tiles are capped at zoom 7).
```yaml
rainviewer: true
show_rainviewer_button: true
```

### 🌍 Live Earthquakes (USGS)
Recent earthquakes worldwide as magnitude-scaled, depth-colored circles, refreshed every 5 minutes.
```yaml
usgs_earthquakes: true
show_usgs_button: true
usgs_min_magnitude: 2.5
usgs_feed: day            # day | week
```
> 💡 Earthquakes appear wherever they occur, so a home-zoomed map usually shows none — **zoom out** to a regional/global view to see the circles.

### 🌡️ Weather On Your Markers (Open-Meteo) — per entity
Temperature and conditions right on a marker, plus a today + tomorrow forecast in its popup — from Open-Meteo, which needs **no API key**. Enabled **per entity** (in the entity's Marker settings), so you choose which people/trackers show weather.
```yaml
entities:
  - entity: person.alice
    weather_badges: true
```

### 🕐 Local Time in Popups
When a marker sits in a different time zone than your Home Assistant, its popup shows the local time there. Automatic — no configuration.

*Attributions: RainViewer, WAQI/EPA, Open-Meteo (CC-BY), USGS.*

# 🆓 Free Google Tools (v6.01)

These features are powered by the **already-loaded** Google Maps JavaScript API and render entirely in your browser — they make **no additional billable API calls** (only the one map load, which has a generous free tier). All default OFF.

### 📏 Measure tool
A map button (`show_measure_button`) that enters *measure mode*: click points on the map to draw a path and read the running **distance** (and the enclosed **area** once you place 3+ points). Toggle the button off to clear.

### ⏱️ History Playback Scrubber
A map button (`show_playback_button`) that opens a **timeline bar** at the bottom of the map. Press **play** and every tracked entity's marker glides along its own history while its trail draws itself in; drag the **slider** to scrub to any moment; pick a **speed** (1× / 2× / 4× / 8×). The bar shows the exact date & time. It replays the history the card has **already loaded**, so it makes **no extra API calls**. Multiple entities share one timeline, so you can watch how everyone moved together. When you've picked a **date range** (date-picker or a preset) the timeline spans exactly that range; otherwise it covers the rolling *Hours to Show* window. Closing the bar snaps straight back to the live map.

```yaml
show_playback_button: true
show_playback_button_position: TOP_RIGHT   # optional
```

### 🌐 Geodesic (great-circle) trails
History and flight trails follow the true shortest path over the curved Earth (they curve on the map over long distances — exactly how real flight paths look). **On by default.** Set `geodesic_polylines: false` for straight screen-space lines.

### 🗺️ GeoJSON overlays
Draw your own shapes — property boundaries, non-circular geofences, delivery zones, trails, regions — from GeoJSON, rendered client-side (works on self-hosted HA, no public URL needed):

```yaml
geojson_layers:
  - url: /local/property.geojson    # HA www folder, or any reachable URL
    stroke_color: '#e30613'
    fill_color: '#e30613'
    fill_opacity: 0.15
    stroke_width: 2
    show_popup: true                # click a shape → show its properties
  - entity: sensor.my_geofence      # or read GeoJSON from an entity attribute…
    attribute: geojson              # (default attribute name: geojson)
  - geojson: { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [ ... ] }   # …or inline
```
> Sources: `url` (fetched client-side), `entity` (reads a GeoJSON attribute/state), or inline `geojson`. Entity-source overlays are refreshed when the card redraws (open/reload/config change), not on every state tick.

### 📐 Distance lines between entities
Draw a live "as-the-crow-flies" line with a distance label between two entities (or an entity and a zone) — e.g. how far a person is from home, or between two trackers. Updates as they move. Configure it visually in the editor's **Panels** tab (Distance Lines → **+ Add**), or in YAML:

```yaml
distance_lines:
  - from: person.alice
    to: zone.home
    color: '#7e57c2'
  - from: person.alice
    to: person.bob
```
> This is a **free** straight-line distance — for turn-by-turn driving/walking routes with traffic, use the [Route Search & Travel Time Calculator](#-route-search-and-travel-time-calculator-v504) (which does use billable APIs).

### 📍 Styled popup for map places
Google's own popup when you click a place or transit-station icon is tiny and can't be restyled. The card **always** intercepts the click and shows **its own** styled popup instead — with the **street address** (reverse-geocoded), the coordinates, the nearest tracked entity + distance, and one-tap **Google Maps** / **Directions** links. There's nothing to configure.

> The street address is reverse-geocoded via **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim)** — keyless and **free**, so it needs **no Google Geocoding API** and won't touch your Google quota. Results are cached per location in the browser, so repeats never hit the network. The place/station *name* is not shown — that would need the paid Places API. Applies to *all* place icons, not just transit stations.

### 🚨 Speed-camera integrations (rich popups)

Two speed-camera integrations get a **dedicated popup layout** — the integration's traffic-sign icon plus a clean field list instead of the generic popup:

* **[Blitzer.de](https://github.com/Ludy87/blitzer)** (`geo_location.blitzer*`) — City, Area, Street, Zip, Speed Limit, Confirmation, Type, ID.
* **[Lufop Radar](https://github.com/somansch/lufop_radar)** (`geo_location.lufop_radar*`, FR/BE/NL) — City, Area, Street, Speed Limit, Type, **Flash Direction**, **Azimuth**, Country, ID. 🆕 (v5.16)

Just add the integration's areas to `geo_location_sources`; the card detects them automatically — no extra config.

# Enabling Clustering (History Dots)

If you enable clustering, route history markers will be grouped depending on zoom level.
More zoom = more granularity. This increases performance on slow systems.

> Note (v4.0.0): FlightRadar markers are excluded from clustering by design.

## 🔧 Parameters

### 🧹 General Options

| Key                    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`                 | string  | Required for Home Assistant custom card. Must be `custom:google-map-card`.                                                           |
| `api_key`              | string  | Your Google Maps JavaScript API key (**required**).                                                                                  |
| `zoom`                 | integer / string | Initial zoom level (1–22). Accepts a static number (e.g. `12`) or a Home Assistant entity ID (e.g. `input_number.map_zoom`) for dynamic zoom control. |
| `no_world_repeat`      | boolean | **NEW (v5.16)** Limit zoom-out so the world is shown **exactly once** — stops the zoom before continents start repeating side by side. Adapts to the card's width **and** height automatically (and re-adapts on resize). On a wide card the world fills the width (poles slightly cropped, pannable up/down); on a tall card it fills the height. **Default: `true`** — set `no_world_repeat: false` to restore Google's default infinite zoom-out (with repeating continents). |
| `theme_mode`           | string  | Map theme name from built-in themes (`Dark_Blueish_Night`, etc.). **Not available when `rendering_type: vector`** — use `color_scheme` instead. |
| `rendering_type`       | string  | Map rendering engine. `raster` (default) or `vector`. Vector mode enables free 360° rotation and tilt on all map types. See [Vector Map & Free Rotation](#-vector-map--free-rotation-new) below. |
| `color_scheme`         | string  | Color scheme for vector mode only. `light` (default), `dark`, or `follow_system`. Has no effect when `rendering_type: raster`. |
| `aspect_ratio`         | string  | Card aspect ratio (`16:9`, `4:3`, `1`, `1:1.56`, `400px`, etc.). If omitted, the card expands to fill its container — recommended for **Sections dashboard** users who set `grid_options: columns: full`. See [Dashboard Layout Tips](#-dashboard-layout-tips) below. |
| `map_type`             | string  | Map type: `roadmap`, `satellite`, `hybrid`, or `terrain`. Default: `roadmap`.                                                        |
| `gesture_handling`     | string  | `cooperative` for CTRL+SCROLL, `greedy` for just SCROLL, `auto`                                                                      |
| `marker_clustering`    | boolean | If `true`, **history dots** will be grouped depending on zoom level. Increases performance for slow systems.                         |
| `proximity_clustering` | boolean | If `true`, entities within the defined radius will be grouped until zoom level is higher than 17                                     |
| `proximity_radius`     | number  | Radius of proximity cluster default: 150                                                                                             |
| `spiderfy`             | boolean | If `true`, after some zoom level, icons of entities with exact location will be separated by some distance in order to see all icons |
| `allow_open_google_maps`   | boolean | Allow opening Google Maps from info popups via right-click / long-press. Default: `true`.             |
| `hide_map_links`           | boolean | Hide Google Maps & Apple Maps links from all info popups. Default: `false`. **NEW (v5.0.4)**          |
| `history_preset`           | string  | Relative date range preset. Accepted values: `today`, `yesterday`, `last7`, `last15`. When set, the date range is **recalculated on every page load** relative to the current date — so it never goes stale. Overrides `history_start_date` / `history_end_date`. |
| `history_start_date`   | string  | Fixed start of the date range (ISO 8601, e.g. `"2026-02-20T21:00:00.000Z"`). Used only when `history_preset` is `null`. |
| `history_end_date`     | string  | Fixed end of the date range (ISO 8601). Used only when `history_preset` is `null`. |
| `stale_marker_minutes` | number  | **NEW (v5.2)** Fade out a marker whose entity hasn't updated for this many minutes. `0` (default) = never fade. |
| `show_popup_address`   | boolean | **NEW (v5.2)** Show a reverse-geocoded street address in marker popups. Default: `true`. |
| `zone_occupancy_badge` | boolean | **NEW (v5.2)** Show a badge on each shown zone counting how many tracked entities are inside it. Default: `false`. |

> ⚠️ Naming note: Older docs may mention `marker_clustring` / `clustring`. The correct key is **`marker_clustering`**.

> 📅 **Migration note (v4.0.2):** `history_start_date` and `history_end_date` have moved from **per-entity** to **card-level**. The per-entity boolean `use_date_range: true` now opts an entity into the shared card-level date range. Old configs with per-entity dates will be auto-migrated on first edit.

| `follow`                        | boolean | If `true`, map will center on this entity. When multiple entities have `follow: true`, the map will fit all of them.            |
| `show_history_dots`             | boolean | If `false`, location history dots are not rendered. May increase speed of map rendering for long time period data.              |
| `history_timestamp_attribute` | string  | Optional state attribute containing the actual measurement/fix time for history points (Unix seconds, Unix milliseconds, numeric string, or ISO 8601). Falls back to the normal HA history timestamp if missing/invalid. |
| `history_timestamp_lookahead_hours` | number | When `history_timestamp_attribute` is set, extends the Recorder query beyond the displayed end time so delayed/offline points can still be discovered. `0` (default) disables look-ahead. |
| `history_dot_shape`             | string  | Shape of history dots: `circle` (default), `square`, `triangle`, `diamond`, `star`, `pentagon`. Helps distinguish entities with similar colors. |
| `history_dot_size`              | integer | Size of history dots in pixels. When omitted, auto-derived from polyline width (4× polyline width, minimum 4px). |
| `history_dot_filled`            | boolean | If `true` (default), dots are filled solid. If `false`, dots are rendered as outlines only. |
| `use_date_range`                | boolean | If `true`, this entity uses the **card-level** date range (`history_preset` or `history_start_date`/`history_end_date`) instead of `hours_to_show`. When enabled, `hours_to_show` is ignored for this entity. |
| `gps_accuracy_ranges`           | obj     | `min`,`max`,`label`,`color`,`opacity` see example below                                                                         |

| `min_accuracy`                  | number  | **NEW (v5.2) GPS jitter filter.** Inside your shown zones, history points whose GPS accuracy is worse (larger) than this many meters are dropped from the polyline, so a stationary entity's trail doesn't jump. `0`/unset = no filtering. |
| `weather_badges`                | boolean | **NEW (v5.15)** Show an Open-Meteo temperature + condition badge on this marker and a today + tomorrow forecast in its popup (no API key). `person`/`device_tracker` only. Default: `false`. |
| `name`                          | string  | **NEW (v6.02)** Custom display name for this entity, replacing its Home Assistant name everywhere on the card (marker tooltip, popup title, panels). Leave unset to keep the HA name. |
| `picture`                       | string  | **NEW (v6.02)** Custom marker image — give a photo to entities Home Assistant has no picture for (`device_tracker`, `sensor`, …), or replace a `person`'s. Accepts `/local/...` or a full URL. Rendered as the usual circular marker. |
| `show_name`                     | boolean | **NEW (v6.02)** Print the entity's name under its marker on the map (the custom `name` when set, otherwise the HA name). Combines with `show_marker_labels` / `weather_badges` in one label. Default: `false`. |

### ⏱️ Delayed / offline tracker timestamps

For trackers that buffer GPS fixes while offline and upload them later, Home Assistant Recorder timestamps reflect **when HA received the state**, not necessarily when the GPS fix was measured.

You can opt an entity into using a real measurement timestamp stored in one of its attributes:

```yaml
entities:
  - entity: device_tracker.example_history
    hours_to_show: 24
    history_timestamp_attribute: fix_timestamp
    history_timestamp_lookahead_hours: 24
```

With this configuration:

- history points use `attributes.fix_timestamp` when it contains a valid timestamp;
- invalid or missing values fall back to Home Assistant's normal history timestamp;
- the card queries far enough beyond the displayed end time to discover delayed states, then filters and sorts them using the effective timestamp;
- live history updates for that entity trigger a timestamp-aware refetch, so late points can be inserted chronologically instead of being appended at receipt time.

Both options are per-entity and fully opt-in. Existing configurations are unchanged.

Each item: `url` / `entity`(+`attribute`) / inline `geojson`, plus `stroke_color`, `fill_color`, `fill_opacity`, `stroke_width`, `show_popup`. See [Free Google Layers & Tools](#-free-google-layers--tools-v601). |
| `distance_lines` | list | **NEW (v6.01)** Live crow-flies distance lines between entities. Each item: `from`, `to` (entity/zone ids), optional `color`. Free — no billable API. |
| `daynight`      | boolean | **NEW (v5.15)** Enable the Day/Night terminator overlay at load. Its map button is toggled separately (`show_daynight_button`). Default: `false`. |
| `rainviewer`    | boolean | **NEW (v5.15)** Enable the animated Rain Radar overlay at load. Its map button is toggled separately (`show_rainviewer_button`). Default: `false`. |
| `waqi_token`    | string  | **NEW (v5.15)** Free World Air Quality Index token from [aqicn.org/data-platform/token](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token). Required for the AQI layer. |
| `waqi_style`    | string  | **NEW (v5.15)** AQI tile style: `usepa-aqi` (default) or `asean-pm10`. |

| `usgs_feed`     | string  | **NEW (v5.15)** Live feed window: `day` (default) or `week`. |

> 💡 **Data-layer pattern:** each overlay splits into a **layer** (the `daynight` / `rainviewer` / `usgs_earthquakes` / `waqi_token` keys above = its state at load) and a **map button** (`show_*_button` in Map Buttons = the on-map toggle). The button toggle is remembered per card in the browser, so a layer you switch on with its button stays on across reloads. `weather_badges` is **per entity** (see the Entities table).

### ⚠️ Rotate & Tilt Limitations (Raster Mode)

The `rotateControl` button in **raster mode** (default) allows rotating and tilting the map to a 45° perspective view, but it comes with significant Google API constraints that are important to understand.

**When it works:**
- Map type must be set to `satellite` or `hybrid`
- Zoom level must be **15 or higher**
- You must be in a city where Google has captured **45° aerial imagery**

**Cities with known 45° imagery support** (non-exhaustive):
New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, Sydney, Toronto, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Rome, Dubai

**When it does NOT work:**
- `map_type: roadmap` or `map_type: terrain` — the button will appear but have no effect
- Rural areas, small towns, or regions without 45° Google imagery
- Low zoom levels (below ~15)

**Recommended config for best results with raster `rotateControl`:**

```yaml
map_type: satellite   # or hybrid
zoom: 17
rotateControl: true
rotateControl_position: LEFT_BOTTOM
```

> 💡 For full 360° free rotation on any map type, use `rendering_type: vector` instead. See below.

### 🔄 Vector Map & Free Rotation (NEW)

By setting `rendering_type: vector`, the card switches to Google Maps' WebGL-based vector renderer. This unlocks **free 360° rotation and tilt on any map type** — including roadmap and terrain — with no Map ID or Google Cloud Console setup required.

**What changes in vector mode:**

- `rotateControl: true` enables full drag-to-rotate and pinch-to-tilt gestures
- `cameraControl: true` shows a **custom rotate & tilt grid** instead of the native pan buttons:

```
        [ ↑ Decrease Tilt ]
[ ← Rotate ]  [ ⟳ Reset ]  [ → Rotate ]
        [ ↓ Increase Tilt ]
```

  Rotate step: **15°** — Tilt step: **10°** (range: 0°–67.5°) — ⟳ resets both to 0

- **Right-click + drag** tilts the map: drag down → more perspective, drag up → flatter. Release without dragging → right-click popup opens normally
- `theme_mode` is **not supported** — use `color_scheme` instead (`light`, `dark`, `follow_system`)
- The 40+ built-in JSON themes are unavailable (Google API limitation — the `styles` array only works on raster maps)
- Requires a WebGL-capable browser (all modern browsers supported by Home Assistant qualify)

**Config example:**

```yaml
type: custom:google-map-card
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
rendering_type: vector
color_scheme: dark          # light | dark | follow_system
cameraControl: true         # shows rotate/tilt grid in vector mode
cameraControl_position: RIGHT_BOTTOM
rotateControl: true         # enables drag-to-rotate & pinch-to-tilt gestures
map_type: roadmap
zoom: 15
```

**Raster vs Vector — quick comparison:**

| | Raster (default) | Vector |
|---|---|---|
| Free 360° rotation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Rotate/tilt grid control | ❌ | ✅ (via `cameraControl`) |
| Right-click drag to tilt | ❌ | ✅ |
| 40+ built-in themes | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dark / Light mode | Via themes | `color_scheme` |
| POI filtering | ✅ | ✅ |
| Traffic layer | ✅ | ✅ |
| Weather layer | ✅ | ✅ |
| GPU / WebGL required | ❌ | ✅ |

> ⚠️ `color_scheme` can only be set at map initialization. If you change it, the page must reload to take effect. In Home Assistant, saving the card config triggers a reload automatically.
